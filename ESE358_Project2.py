ESE 358 Project 2
Original Matlab project by: M. Subbarao, ECE, SBU
Python Template : Revised by TA C. Orlassino (8/31/2022)
Project done by Nehal Kabir
Stable version: python 3.8

Don't touch the import statements. The template uses numpy and cv2.

Installing necessary packages:
* Many IDEs will prompt you to install automatically on a failed import
* If not, run from console in this directory: "pip install opencv-python"
* Try "pip3" or "py -m pip" if "pip" doesn't work for you 
* ^This depends on your environment variables set when you installed python

More info on necessary packages:
cv2 package: https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/
numpy package: https://numpy.org/install/
